## Core Features:

- Visual Redesign: Implement a Valorant-inspired visual theme, focusing on sharp, angular designs and a dark background with neon accents to provide a futuristic feel. Maintain the existing website structure from the GitHub repository.
- Button Standardization: Create uniform buttons in size, padding, and placement across the website, styled with a pink color (#e94560) and smooth hover transitions.
- Background Overhaul: Develop a new background that combines navy and dark gray with geometric patterns, mimicking a HUD interface, and subtle lavender or pink glow effects for added depth.
- Font Change: Convert text and titles to use the specified 'Valorant' font or a suitable alternative (Orbitron, Rajdhani, or Barlow Condensed).
- Card Redesign: Update all card elements with a modern design that includes a navy or pink base color, slightly rounded borders, subtle shadows, and engaging zoom or contrast change animations on hover.
- Year Update: Consistently update all instances of the year to '2025' throughout the website, including in the footer, banners, and event titles to maintain accuracy.
- Responsiveness and Polish: Ensure the website is fully responsive on both mobile and desktop, presenting a clean, professional, and energetic interface. The underlying code structure remains identical to the linked GitHub repository.
